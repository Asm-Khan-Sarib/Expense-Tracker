        <p class="headings">Welcome</p>
        <p class="elements">
            Welcome to our website "Expense Tracker". In this website, you can track your expenses so that you don't
            spend more than your budget.
        </p>
        <p class="headings">How to create or update profile?</p>
        <p class="elements">
            To use all the features of this website, you need to create a profile. By clicking the "Create Profile"
            button on the home page, you can go to a new page where you need to enter your name and email and click the
            "Save" button to create a profile.<br>
            If you have already created a profile, you will see that the "Create Profile" button has changed to "Update
            Profile". Now you can change your name and email whenever you want.
        </p>
        <p class="headings">What is this "Home Page" about?</p>
        <p class="elements">
            The home page is a nice and clean starting point. From there, you can go to any page of this website.<br>
            There is a button at the center of the page. By clicking this button, you can create and update your
            profile.
        </p>
        <p class="headings">How can I view my expenses?</p>
        <p class="elements">
            At the "Transactions" page, there is a drop-down button named "Show All Transactions". From here, you can
            choose how you would like to orient your transactions.<br>
            There are two options here, the first one is "Sort by Time" and the second one is "Sort by Category". By
            selecting any of these, you can see the full list of your expenses.
        </p>
        <p class="headings">How can I see the chart?</p>
        <p class="elements">
            At the "Reports" page, there are three buttons. The first one is for "Doughnut Chart", the second one is for
            "Bar Chart", and the third one is for "Remove Chart".
        </p>
        <p class="headings">How can I add expenses?</p>
        <p class="elements">
            At the "Add Expenses" page, you will find a form to enter information about your expenses. You need to enter
            the amount you spent, date, small description (this is optional), and select a category.<br>
            After filling out the form, you just need to click the "Save" button. Your expenses will be saved, and you
            will see a confirmation message.
        </p>
        <p class="headings">How can I delete expenses?</p>
        <p class="elements">
            At the "Delete Expenses" page, there are two options for deleting your saved expenses. The first one is to
            delete one expense manually, and the second one is to quick delete.<br>
            For the first one, you need to enter the transaction ID (in the transaction list, the left-side number is
            the transaction ID) that you want to delete and click the "Delete" button. Your expense will be deleted, and
            you will get a confirmation message.<br>
            For the second one, there are three buttons. By clicking these buttons, you can quickly delete your
            expenses.
        </p>
        <p class="headings">Why can't I click any buttons?</p>
        <p class="elements">
            You need to create a profile to use this website.
        </p>
        <p class="headings">Will my saved information be removed, if I turn off my device?</p>
        <p class="elements">
            No.<br>
            Even if you turn off your device, your information will be saved. But if you clear the local storage data of
            your browser, you might lose all your saved information.
